# Health Skills Implementation Handoff

**Date:** 2025-11-30
**Session:** Health Foundation Trilogy (sleep, strength, nutrition)
**Decision:** Option 5 - Framework Partnership (intensive collaborative session)
**Status:** Ready for implementation session

---

## Context

User identified major gap in superskills: **Zero physical health skills** despite health being foundational to everything else (energy, focus, mood, productivity).

**Current superskills (9):**
- Business (2): weekly-review, decision-making
- Productivity (2): daily-shutdown, daily-startup ✨ (just created)
- Inner (1): self-connection
- Communication (1): nvc-conversation
- Creative (1): brainstorming
- Meta (2): using-superskills, creating-superskills

**Gap:** No skills for strength, cardio, flexibility, sleep, nutrition, recovery

---

## Decision-Making Process Summary

Used `business:decision-making` skill to determine approach.

### Phase 1: Frame
**Decision:** How to approach creating health skills (sleep, strength, nutrition)

**What this is really about:**
- Level 1: Which skills to create first?
- Level 2: How to build effective health habits that actually stick?
- Level 3: What system will help achieve lasting physical health improvements?

**Decision type:** Type 2 (reversible, can iterate)

**Goal:** Build complete system for anyone to use (not just personal tool)

### Phase 2: Gather - What Works

**Sleep:**
- ✅ Consistent routine (same bed/wake times)
- ✅ Environment control (dark, cool, quiet)
- ✅ Wind-down ritual (pre-bed routine)

**Strength:**
- ✅ Progressive programs (5/3/1, Starting Strength, etc.)
- ✅ Tracking workouts (logging progress systematically)
- ✅ Simple routines (basic compound movements)

**Nutrition:**
- ✅ Meal prep (preparing food in advance)
- ✅ Tracking/counting (macros or calories)
- ✅ Simple rules (whole foods, avoid processed)

**Key Insight:** User knows what works technically. Challenge is **consistency** when:
- Motivation fades (initial excitement wears off)
- Life disruptions (travel, stress, schedule changes)

### Phase 3: Options Generated

**Option 1:** Sequential (one skill → proven → next) - 3-4 months
**Option 2:** Parallel system (all three together) - 1-2 weeks
**Option 3:** MVP trilogy (simple → iterate) - 1-2 days
**Option 4:** Foundation cascade (sleep → strength → nutrition) - 2-3 weeks
**Option 5:** Framework partnership (intensive session) - 2-4 hours ✅ **CHOSEN**

### Phase 4-6: Evaluation & Decision

**Chosen:** Option 5 - Framework Partnership

**Why:**
- Fastest to complete integrated system
- Coherent framework (all three work together)
- Leverage AI expertise + user's proven knowledge
- Can test/refine after creation

**Tradeoff accepted:** Intensive time commitment in one session (vs. spread over weeks)

## Implementation Plan for Next Session

### New Domain: `health:*`

Create three foundational skills as integrated system:

#### 1. `health:sleep-routine`

**Framework grounding:**
- Matthew Walker's "Why We Sleep"
- Sleep hygiene research (NSF guidelines)
- Circadian rhythm science
- Andrew Huberman's sleep protocols

**Core phases:**
- Wind-down ritual (90-60 min before bed)
- Sleep environment optimization
- Consistent schedule (same bed/wake times)
- Morning wake protocol (light exposure, delay caffeine)
- Recovery from bad nights

**Key features:**
- Pairs with daily-shutdown (work closure → sleep prep)
- Pairs with daily-startup (wake protocol → work mode)
- Tracking: sleep quality, duration, wake feeling
- Disruption handling (travel, stress, etc.)

**Common pitfalls:**
- "Just one more episode/chapter" (no hard stop time)
- Inconsistent weekends (social jet lag)
- Phone in bed (blue light + infinite scroll)
- Caffeine too late (6-hour half-life)

**Length target:** 200-300 lines

---

#### 2. `health:strength-program`

**Framework grounding:**
- Progressive overload principle (Selye, Zatsiorsky)
- Evidence-based programs (5/3/1, Starting Strength, GZCLP)
- Recovery science (Schoenfeld, Mike Israetel)
- Simplicity (compound movements, linear progression)

**Core phases:**
- Program selection (match to experience level)
- Workout tracking (sets, reps, weight progression)
- Progressive overload (when/how to add weight)
- Deload weeks (planned recovery)
- Plateau handling (reset, switch program, etc.)

**Key features:**
- Integrates with sleep-routine (recovery is training)
- Integrates with nutrition (fuel for performance)
- Tracking template (simple spreadsheet or app)
- Travel/disruption protocols (maintenance vs. progression)

**Common pitfalls:**
- Program hopping (never seeing results)
- No tracking (guessing what you lifted last time)
- Ego lifting (form breaks down for heavier weight)
- No deloads (burn out, injury risk)
- Ignoring recovery (sleep, nutrition, stress)

**Length target:** 250-350 lines (includes program templates)

---

#### 3. `health:nutrition-planning`

**Framework grounding:**
- Evidence-based macros (ISSN, Examine.com)
- Meal prep systems (batch cooking, containers)
- Flexible dieting (80/20, sustainable not perfect)
- Dr. Mike Israetel's "Diet Periodization"

**Core phases:**
- Calculate needs (TDEE, macro targets)
- Meal planning (weekly system)
- Meal prep workflow (shopping → cooking → storage)
- Tracking (app-based or simple rules)
- Adjustment protocol (not losing/gaining as expected)

**Key features:**
- Integrates with strength-program (fuel training)
- Simple rules option (for those who hate tracking)
- Disruption handling (eating out, travel, social events)
- Template meals (proven combinations that work)

**Common pitfalls:**
- Perfectionism (all-or-nothing thinking)
- Not tracking protein (most important macro)
- Cutting too aggressively (lose muscle, tank energy)
- No meal prep (reactive daily decisions fail)
- Ignoring hunger/fullness cues (override body signals)

**Length target:** 250-350 lines

## System Integration Points

These three skills work together as a system:

**Sleep → Strength:**
- Poor sleep = poor recovery = worse strength gains
- Sleep skill feeds into strength skill (recovery monitoring)

**Sleep → Nutrition:**
- Poor sleep = worse food choices (hunger hormones dysregulated)
- Sleep skill informs nutrition (energy needs vary)

**Strength → Nutrition:**
- Training drives nutrition needs (protein for recovery)
- Nutrition skill supports strength skill (fueling performance)

**All three → Consistency:**
- Each skill includes disruption protocols (travel, stress, etc.)
- Each skill includes motivation/accountability systems
- Cross-reference between skills (holistic approach)

---

## Success Criteria

**Immediately after creation:**

- ✅ Grounded in evidence-based frameworks
- ✅ 200-350 lines each
- ✅ Cross-referenced as integrated system
- ✅ Include disruption/recovery protocols

**6 months after use:**

- Skills survive disruptions (travel, stress)
- Motivation sustained through tracking/progress

**2 years:**
- Proven framework that works for diverse users
- Refined based on real-world feedback

## Key Principles to Embed

**1. Consistency > Perfection**
- Skills should make 80% adherence achievable
- Perfect is the enemy of good
- Flexible approach (not rigid rules)

**2. Sustainability > Intensity**
- Can you do this for years? (not just weeks)
- Life-proof systems (survive disruptions)
- Motivation fades → systems persist

**3. Tracking → Progress**
- What gets measured gets managed
- Simple tracking (not overwhelming)
- Progress visibility (maintain motivation)

**4. Recovery = Training**
- Sleep, nutrition, deloads are not optional
- Recovery enables adaptation
- Respect the system

**5. Start Simple → Add Complexity**
- Basic version works for most people
- Advanced options available
- Prevent analysis paralysis
